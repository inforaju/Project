# Facial Recognition Attendance System  

The **Facial Recognition Attendance System** is a Python-based application designed to automate attendance management using facial recognition technology. This system uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces, marking attendance in real time.  

## Features  
- üì∏ **Facial Recognition**: Identifies and verifies individuals based on their facial features.  
- üïí **Real-Time Attendance**: Marks attendance as faces are recognized during live sessions.  
- üìÇ **Database Integration**: Stores attendance records in a database for easy retrieval and management.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Python-Powered**: Built with Python and libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pandas.  
- üìä **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies user interactions with a clear and intuitive design.  
- üîí **Secure**: Ensures data integrity and minimizes manual errors.

## Requirements  

To run the system, ensure the following dependencies are installed:  

- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow  
- OpenCV  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- SQL or CSV database support  

Install dependencies via pip:  

```bash  
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pandas numpy  
```

## How It Works  

1. **Face Detection**: The system uses OpenCV to detect faces in real time from a webcam or camera feed.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: TensorFlow processes facial features for recognition.  
3. **Recognition and Matching**: Compares extracted features with stored data to identify individuals.  
4. **Attendance Marking**: Updates the database with the identified individual's attendance.

## Getting Started  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link/facial-recognition-attendance-system.git  
cd facial-recognition-attendance-system  
```  

### Run the Application  
```bash  
python attendance_system.py  
```  

### Adding New Users  
1. Run the `register_user.py` script to capture a new user's face and store their data.  
2. Add the user's name and other details to the database.
